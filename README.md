# COSMIC Application Template

A template for developing applications for the COSMICâ„¢ desktop environment using [libcosmic][libcosmic].

## Getting Started

To create an application with this template, [install `cargo generate`][cargo-generate] and run:

```sh
cargo generate gh:pop-os/cosmic-app-template
```

A [justfile](./justfile) is included by default with common recipes used by other COSMIC projects. Install from [casey/just][just]

- `just` builds the application with the default `just build-release` recipe
- `just run` builds and runs the application
- `just install` installs the project into the system
- `just vendor` creates a vendored tarball
- `just build-vendored` compiles with vendored dependencies from that tarball
- `just check` runs clippy on the project to check for linter warnings
- `just check-json` can be used by IDEs that support LSP
